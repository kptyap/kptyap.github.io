<p>Power is not what it once was. A brief history and examination of what power means to us as humans leads us to the present day, where we are shown how traditional power structures are facing new challenges due to a combination of factors that have sprung up only in the last two decades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>What is Power?</h1>
<p>The capacity to get others to do, or to stop doing. A has power over B to the extent that A can get B to do something that they would otherwise not normally do.</p>
<p>Power cannot be measured, only its proxies.</p>
<p>There are 4 channels of power:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The muscle (‘coercion’)</strong></li>
<li><strong>The code (‘obligation’)</strong></li>
<li><strong>The reward (‘inducement’,)</strong></li>
<li><strong>The pitch (‘persuasion’)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Macmillan, Ian, <em>Strategy Formulation: Political Concepts, </em>1978</p>

<ul>
<li>Barriers to power are obstacles that stop new players from exercising one of the above.</li>
<li>The time during which men live without a common power to keep them in check is called a War.</li>
<li>A world where players have enough power to block everyone else’s initiatives but no one has the power to impose their preferred course of action is an inefficient, ineffective world.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The traditional answer to how to gain and maintain power was to <strong>get big </strong>(centralised and large structures)</li>
<li>Max Weber’s definition of bureaucracy – the most advanced form of organisation humans had achieved and one best suited for progress in a capitalist society</li>
<li>Gap between real and perceived power is one of the hardest expectations to manage</li>
<li>Transaction costs determine the growth, nature and organisation of modern firms</li>
<li>Wright Mills, <em>White Collar: The American Middle Class</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chandler’s three models of capitalism during the second industrial revolution:</p>
<ol>
<li>Personal capitalism (UK)</li>
<li>Competitive / managerial capitalism (USA)</li>
<li>Cooperative capitalism (Germany)</li>
</ol>
<p>Chandler argued that competitive capitalism achieved through manager-owner separation, which enabled the common corporate structure (M-form) seen today, granted American firms an advantage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing ability of weaker parties to inflict disproportionate injuries on their opponents</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The decoupling of power from size, and thus the decoupling of the capacity to use power effectively from the control of a large Weberian bureaucracy is changing the world”</p>
<ul>
<li>If the future of power lies in disruption and interference rather than management and consolidation, then can we ever expect to know stability again?</li>
<li>Ironically, the core promise of power is that of stability.</li>
<li>The new powers will not necessarily dislodge the old, but they will narrow their possibilities and reduce their power</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>The More revolution: overwhelming the means of control</h1>
<ul>
<li>Vast improvements to the world’s socioeconomic landscape in the last three decades
<ul>
<li>Rise of the middle class</li>
<li>Higher levels of education</li>
<li>Improved life expectancies (leading to the ‘youth bulge’ in many countries)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When people are better nourished, healthier, more educated, better informed and more connected than before, many of the factors that locked power in place are no longer effective
<ul>
<li>When people are more numerous and living better lives they become harder to regiment and control</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Mobility revolution</h1>
<ul>
<li>When people move around more they are harder to regiment and control</li>
<li>Immigrants are changing the businesses and cultures of the places they move to
<ul>
<li>They also send large remittances back home, promoting growth and development in those (poorer) countries</li>
<li>Remittances x5 larger than global foreign aid and larger than the total foreign investment to poor countries</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Urbanisation is also changing the face of countries (2007 was the first time in history that more people lived in cities than in rural areas)</li>
<li>Brain circulation is another factor – poor countries lose brains to richer countries – however this trend has been reversing in recent years with the rise of people returning as VCs</li>
<li>Increasing international trade and short term international travel</li>
<li>Increasing international exchange of money</li>
<li>Increasing flow of information (mainly via the prepaid phone cards, then the internet, then smartphones)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Mentality revolution</h1>
<ul>
<li>A profound change in expectations and standards have come about</li>
<li>Most people look at the world with different eyes than their parents did, and this has been exacerbated by the More and Mobility revolutions - a sharpening of the intergenerational gaps in mentality and worldview
<ul>
<li>This then increases the propensity of the young to question authority and challenge power</li>
</ul>

<p>Import Figure 4.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>In a scatted election landscape, it is a good to be a small party with extreme views or a single issue focus, these do not need to dilute their stance to attract middle-of-the-road voters</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The move to charismatic Christianity and away from the larger hierarchical, austere Catholic church is as much an example of small, nimble players out manoeuvring the large centralised incumbent as it is of the three revolutions.
<ul>
<li>The sheep have not been stolen. They have become consumers and they have found a more attractive product in the market for their salvation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Consequences</h1>
<ul>
<li>Facilitated the rise of extremists politics</li>
<li>Deskilling and potential loss of knowledge</li>
<li>The banalisation of social movements “slacktivism”</li>
<li>Boosting impatience and shortening attention spans
<ul>
<li>hard for actual worthy causes to gain traction in a sea of noise</li>
<li>governments can’t get anything done if always being changed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decay of the traditional power structure of the family</li>
<li>Great opportunities for poor leaders with bad ideas (‘terrible simplifiers’)</li>
<li>Less international agreement on policies</li>
</ul>
<h1>The future?</h1>
<p>We need to change our focus from watching who is rising and falling to understanding what is actually happening inside those parties that do (currently) wield power.</p>
<p>We need to restore our trust in our government and political leaders.</p>
<p>Humanity must find new ways of governing itself.</p>
