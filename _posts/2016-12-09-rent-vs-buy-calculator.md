A simple calculator to determine if you are financially better off to rent or buy a property. Feedback welcomed in the comments below.

Notes:

- this calculator has been tailored to the Australian market (eg. rent is expressed in weeks)
- there are many 'hidden' costs of owning a property that have not been listed here to keep the calculator simple

Stamp duty can be obtained easily [here](http://reiwa.com.au/advice/calculator-tools/stamp-duty-calculator-wa/).

For those who really like the detail, a far more [comprehensive calculator by the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html) is available.
